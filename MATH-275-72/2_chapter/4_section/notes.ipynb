    "A *sequence* is a function from a subset of the set of integers\n",
    "(usually either the set {0, 1 ,2,...} or the set {1,2,3,...}) to a set S\n",
    "We use the notation $a_n$ to denote the image of the integer *n*. \n",
    "We call $a_n$ a *term* of the sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "a geometric progression is a sequence of the form\n",

    "\n",
    "where the initial term a and the common ratio r are real numbers\n",

    "### Definition 4\n",
    "\n",
    "A *recurence relation for the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is an equeation that expresses $a_n$\n",
    "in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence, namely $a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}$,\n",
    "for all integers n with $n \\geq n_0$, where $n_0$ is a nongeative integer. A sequence is called a\n",
    "*solution* of a recurrence relation if its terms satisfy the recurrence relation. (a recurrence \n",
    "relation is said to recursively define a sequence)\n",

    "\n",
    "The *Fibonacci sequence, $f_0, f_1, f_2, ...,$ is defined by the initial condition\n",
